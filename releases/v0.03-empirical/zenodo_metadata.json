  "description": "This release presents empirical validation of commitment conservation principles in neural compression systems. Key findings: baseline systems exhibit 20% stability (4/5 signals show catastrophic semantic drift), while enforced systems achieve 60% stability (3x improvement). The 40 percentage point gap empirically validates the architectural framework. Simple enforcement (extract commitments → compress → check preservation → append if missing) triples stability, proving the theoretical principle operationalizes effectively.",
