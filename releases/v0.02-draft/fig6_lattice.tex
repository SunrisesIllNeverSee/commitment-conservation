\caption{Three-dimensional commitment lattice structure. Blue nodes represent hard commitment vertices ($C_{hard}$) that serve as fixed points in the signal space. The red path shows how a signal (dashed: original trajectory) is projected onto the lattice structure (solid: enforced path), ensuring topological stability under transformation.}
